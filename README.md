### Note:

1. As OpenAI chatGPT API is slow in generating a response, the response time is slow, and there are loading animations to account for that. We'll need to upgrade our plan for faster response times.
2. Questions are fetched from ChatGPT, and answers are also verified using chatGPT.
3. If you've answered a question wrong, you can learn more about it by clicking on the **Learn more** button.
4. Prompts are interpolated with questions and verifications, using the ChatGPT API.

### App is slightly buggy, due to development of the app in less than 2 hours.
